        Hello my name is Hannah! I am a senior in Management
        Information Systems at the University of Nebraska at Omaha.
        I worked as a Software Engineer Intern at Northrop Grumman
        over the summer in Los Angeles. Someday I hope to develop
        my own video game that is centered around strong female
        characters. I wnat to empower more women to pursue their
        passions and to get involved in video games.
